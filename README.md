# Streamroom-golang

This project is a **WebSocket-based video processing server** built with **Go**. It allows clients to send video streams in chunks over WebSocket, processes the received video using **FFmpeg**, converts it to FLV format, and then streams the output to an **RTMP server (Nginx-RTMP)** for further handling (e.g., live streaming or storage).

## How It Works

1. **WebSocket Connection:**
   - Clients connect to the WebSocket server (`/ws` endpoint).
   - They send video data in binary chunks over the connection.
   
2. **Receiving Video Data:**
   - The server collects these chunks and writes them into a temporary file.
   
3. **Processing Video:**
   - Once the full video is received, a task is queued for processing.
   - The task is picked up by a worker from a pool of concurrent workers.
   - FFmpeg converts the received file into FLV format.

# Video Stream Processor

This project is a **WebSocket-based real-time video streaming server** built with **Go**. It allows clients (like browsers) to send **live video streams** over WebSockets, and the server forwards the stream to an **RTMP server (Nginx-RTMP)** using **FFmpeg**. The RTMP server then **transmuxes** the stream into HLS segments for playback.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ WebSocket Connection (Publisher Role)
- Clients connect to the WebSocket server at `/ws?role=publisher&streamKey=<key>`.
- Clients send **video data in binary chunks** over the WebSocket connection.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Room Management
- Each stream (based on `streamKey`) creates a **Room** (a managed stream session).
- Each Room gets its own **goroutine** to handle:
    - Receiving data from WebSocket.
    - Sending data into an FFmpeg process via `stdin`.
    - Monitoring FFmpeg‚Äôs health and lifecycle.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Real-time Processing (FFmpeg)
- FFmpeg receives data **directly from the WebSocket via a Go channel**.
- FFmpeg transcodes the incoming data into **FLV format** and pushes it to the configured RTMP URL:
```
rtmp://<nginx-rtmp>/live/<streamKey>
```

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ RTMP to HLS (Nginx-RTMP)
- Nginx-RTMP receives the stream and **transmuxes** it into HLS segments.
- HLS playlist and segments are served via:
```
http://localhost:8080/hls/live/<streamKey>.m3u8
```

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ WebSocket Connection (Viewer Role)
- Viewers can request the list of active streams via:
```
GET /streams
```
- Viewers can get the playback URL for a given stream:
```
http://localhost:8080/hls/live/<streamKey>.m3u8
```

## ‚ö° Features

**WebSocket support** for real-time video ingest (publishers).  
**Live stream management** using **Goroutines and Channels**.  
**FFmpeg integration** for real-time transcoding (WebM to FLV).  
**RTMP streaming support** for live broadcasting.  
**HLS playback** via Nginx-RTMP.  
**Graceful cleanup** ‚Äî when a stream ends, FFmpeg is stopped and HLS files are removed.  
**Health monitoring** of the FFmpeg process (detect crashes and recover).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `WS_PORT` | WebSocket server port | `9090` |
| `RTMP_BASE_URL` | RTMP server base URL | `rtmp://localhost/live` |
| `HLS_BASE_URL` | HLS playback base URL | `http://localhost:8080/hls/live` |

---

## üöÄ Usage

### 1. Start the Backend
```bash
go run main.go
```

### 2. Start the Nginx-RTMP Container
```bash
docker-compose up nginx-rtmp
```

---

### 3. Publish a Stream (Publisher)
A browser can use:
```
ws://localhost:9090/ws?role=publisher&streamKey=myAwesomeStream
```

---

### 4. Watch the Stream (Viewer)
```
http://localhost:8080/hls/live/myAwesomeStream.m3u8
```

## üì¶ Dependencies

| Library/Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `gorilla/websocket` | WebSocket handling |
| `FFmpeg` | Video processing and transcoding |
| `Nginx-RTMP` | RTMP ingest + HLS output |

---

## Advantages After Refactor

No more blocking ‚Äî every stream runs in its own goroutine.  
Efficient `Room` lifecycle ‚Äî clean start, monitoring, and cleanup.  
Live logs from FFmpeg directly into the server logs for easy debugging.  
No need to buffer full files ‚Äî direct piping from WebSocket to FFmpeg.

---

## Important Note

- To reduce stream startup time, you can tune:
```nginx
hls_fragment 500ms;
hls_playlist_length 1s;
```
- For ultra-low-latency HLS, additional nginx-rtmp patches may be required (optional).

---

## üéâ Conclusion

This system ensures **efficient, scalable, real-time video processing** with Go and modern streaming technologies like RTMP + HLS, while keeping resource usage optimized using **channels and goroutines**.

4. **Streaming to RTMP Server:**
   - The converted FLV file is streamed to an RTMP endpoint (configured in environment variables).
   - After streaming, the temporary files are deleted to free up space.

## Features
- **WebSocket support** for real-time video streaming.
- **Asynchronous processing** using a worker pool to handle multiple uploads efficiently.
- **FFmpeg integration** for video conversion to FLV format.
- **RTMP streaming support** for live video broadcasting.
- **Optimized resource management** with temporary file cleanup and background processing.

## Environment Variables
The server reads configurations from environment variables:
- `WS_PORT`: WebSocket server port (default: `9090`)
- `RTMP_URL`: RTMP server URL (default: `rtmp://localhost/live/stream`)
- `HLS_URL`: HLS playback URL (default: `http://localhost:8080/hls/live/stream.m3u8`)

## Usage
1. Start the Go WebSocket server.
2. Connect a client and start sending a video stream.
3. The server will process the video asynchronously and stream it to the RTMP server.

## Dependencies
- `gorilla/websocket` (WebSocket handling)
- `FFmpeg` (Video processing and conversion)
- `Nginx-RTMP` (Streaming server)

This system ensures **efficient, concurrent, and scalable** video processing while keeping the WebSocket server responsive.
